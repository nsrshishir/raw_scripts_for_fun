@Sadiq Vai MetaKave Sadiq when can we expect some action from this list from our last meeting. You mentioned that you will provide dates when could be implemented. 


1. Fix menu - dynamic mega menu + other categories added to menu
2. Add intermediate page for top categories (e.g furniture) with images to lower categories + top picks carousels
3. Font pairing (Montserrat - headlines + Source Sans - body)
4. Featured - option as a default sorting for listings (app)
5. Introduce collections to put similar products into them as showed on example + shoppable room images with blinking tags to product pages (theme feature)
6. Bottom up design updates - product page > collection pages > home page
7. Search issue (entry + category) not showing correctly
8. Wrong dimensions of the tab
9. Product attributes (for filtering and search) - this we need to move on for some categories
